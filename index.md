## Description
Campus Clearout Center is a program that will allow users of the UHM community to list and post various objects for sale. After all, another man's trash is another man's treasure. But for the UHM community this could be old textbooks, "campus-specific" goods, generally things that need to be recycled which might offer use to another student. The service will allow buyers to easily browse through the item and choose a location on campus to meet.

## System
- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User Profile page
- List Item page
- Create item page
- Make offer on item page
- Report to admin page

## Goal
By the end of the project we will have a working program that will allow users to easily post items that they would like to sell using picture, browse the items posted, and buy the items or make an offer on an item using a form.
